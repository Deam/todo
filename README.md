# Todo app

This is a simple todo app made with
- [Laravel] - PHP framework
- [VueJs] - JS Framework
- [Bootstrap] - CSS Framework

These frameworks were chosen because they are all popular frameworks, and I have some varying degrees of experience using them. This helped me a lot while programming with some time pressure.

## Features

- Create, edit and delete todo items
- Create and edit categories for todo items
- Check off todo items
- Filter and sort todo table
- View todo item details
- And more

## Installation
To use the software, simply run the ```php artisan serve``` command.
Using the ```php artisan migrate``` command we migrate the database to be able to use the data.
Finally we need to build the css and js files using the ```npm run dev``` command
Or if you have some experience using Homestead, you can add it to your Homestead machine
